       <h1>AMY CONEY BARRETT</h1>
       <p>I am inspired by Amy Coney Barrett, she is currently an Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
   She's only 50 years old!
        </li>
    <li>
    She is the 5th woman to serve on the Supreme Court.
        </li>
    <li>
    Barrett earned her undergraduate degree (magna cum laude) in 1994 from Rhodes College in TN and earned a juris doctor (summa cum laude) at Notre Dame Law School in IN in 1997.
        </li>
    <li>
    Before she was confirmed to the Supreme Court on October 26, 2020, she had a long career in law as both a distinguished professor and judge.
        </li>
     <li>
    Amy and her husband Jesse Barrett have seven children--two of whom they adopted from Haiti and a son born with Down syndrome.
        </li>
</ul>
